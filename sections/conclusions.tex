\section{Conclusions}
In this report we presented a simplified biomechanical analysis of the situation
in which a pedestrian collides with a SUV that has a bull bar. More
specifically, we researched whether the femur shaft will break under the
assumptions made in \autoref{sec:assumptions}, the most important of which is
the speed of the SUV (10 m/s). We conclude that under these conditions, the
femur shaft will most definitely break.
